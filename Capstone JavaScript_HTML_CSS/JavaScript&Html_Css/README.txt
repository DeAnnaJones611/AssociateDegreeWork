Hello, 
This is my 2024 Capstone JavaScript Project. For this project we had to create a website for a golf course. On the front end, end users can search items and login in order to insert reservations. On the back end, users would need to login in order for the cookies can work and interact with the forms. 


I had to remove the connection password and login from the server file for security purposes. 

There is no node and modals folder when up loaded, so would need to do npm install to run the code properly.
